A FEW THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND:
1. Ensure business name is inputted accurately!

2. Due to restrictions on non-premium accounts, sometimes it will return a code 500 error due to 
too many requests. Keep trying though, it has consistently worked after leaving it for a minute and trying again!

3. Whilst the Google Reviews function takes directly from the currently uploaded database, due to my lack
of space for a file as large as the Yelp json files, only the items located in the JSON files uploaded
my personal github will work when interacting with those files. However, I am confident this solution
will work for the full Yelp database where it accessible. For example, using a URL such as 
http://localhost:8080/JavaAPI/rest/getReviews?businessName=MountainView%20Hospital&type=yelp
will return reviews for that business, as data related to that business is in the github files. 

4. Have fun, and please, pardon the mess!
